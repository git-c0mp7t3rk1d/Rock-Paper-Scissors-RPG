-- Rock Paper Scissors RPG game --
-- Written by c0mp7t3rk1d-- 

This is a dungeon crawler RPG game that uses Rock Paper Scissors as the combat system.

The game is still in Pre-Alpha, so I'll release it when I've programmed 10 rooms into the game.

Feel free to fork, I'd be happy to include some of your code and credit you!

Edit: I had ChatGPT clean up the code, and in the Rock Paper Scissors logic it uses the modulus operator to avoid having to write out all the possibilities! It's pretty smart.
